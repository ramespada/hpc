En esta secci칩n se presentan algunos problemas pr치cticos para implementar y 
analizar su performance, escalabilidad y entender algunos fen칩menos de la computaci칩n
paralela.

## Command shell

How to automate common and repetitive tasks with aliases, scripts,
and build systems. No more copy-pasting commands from a text
document. No more "run these 15 commands one after the other". No
more "you forgot to run this thing" or "you forgot to pass this
argument".

For example, searching through your history quickly can be a huge time saver. In the example below we show several tricks related to navigating your shell history for `convert` commands.

## Version control

How to use version control _properly_, and take advantage of it to
save you from disaster, collaborate with others, and quickly find and
isolate problematic changes. No more `rm -rf; git clone`. No more
merge conflicts (well, fewer of them at least). No more huge blocks
of commented-out code. No more fretting over how to find what broke
your code. No more "oh no, did we delete the working code?!". We'll
even teach you how to contribute to other people's projects with pull
requests!

In the example below we use `git bisect` to find which commit broke a unit test and then we fix it with `git revert`.

## Text editing

How to efficiently edit files from the command-line, both locally and
remotely, and take advantage of advanced editor features. No more
copying files back and forth. No more repetitive file editing.

Vim macros are one of its best features, in the example below we quickly convert an html table to csv format using a nested vim macro.

## Remote machines

How to stay sane when working with remote machines using SSH keys and
terminal multiplexing. No more keeping many terminals open just to
run two commands at once. No more typing your password every time you
connect. No more losing everything just because your Internet
disconnected or you had to reboot your laptop.

In the example below we use `tmux` to keep sessions alive in remote servers and `mosh` to support network roaming and disconnection.

  <source src="/static/media/demos/ssh.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

## Finding files

How to quickly find files that you are looking for. No
more clicking through files in your project until you find the one
that has the code you want.

In the example below we quickly look for files with `fd` and for code snippets with `rg`. We also quickly `cd` and `vim` recent/frequent files/folder using `fasd`.

  <source src="/static/media/demos/find.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

## Data wrangling

How to quickly and easily modify, view, parse, plot, and compute over
data and files directly from the command-line. No more copy pasting
from log files. No more manually computing statistics over data. No
more spreadsheet plotting.

## Virtual machines

How to use virtual machines to try out new operating systems, isolate
unrelated projects, and keep your main machine clean and tidy. No
more accidentally corrupting your computer while doing a security
lab. No more millions of randomly installed packages with differing
versions.

## Security

How to be on the Internet without immediately revealing all of your
secrets to the world. No more coming up with passwords that match the
insane criteria yourself. No more unsecured, open WiFi networks. No
more unencrypted messaging.

# Conclusion

This, and more, will be covered across the 12 class lectures, each including an
exercise for you to get more familiar with the tools on your own. If you can't
wait for January, you can also take a look at the lectures from [Hacker
Tools](https://hacker-tools.github.io/lectures/), which we ran during IAP last
year. It is the precursor to this class, and covers many of the same topics.

We hope to see you in January, whether virtually or in person!

Happy hacking,<br>
Anish, Jose, and Jon
